# 🍱 Food Recognition & Calorie Estimation

This project uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, helping users track dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Recognize food items from images (e.g., apple, burger, pizza)
- 🔢 Estimate calories per 100g using predefined mappings
- 🧠 Uses MobileNetV2 (transfer learning) for efficient image classification
- 📈 Easily extendable to more classes and deeper models

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. An image of a food item is input
2. The image is processed through a trained CNN model
3. The model predicts the food class
4. Calorie content is estimated using a static mapping for each item
